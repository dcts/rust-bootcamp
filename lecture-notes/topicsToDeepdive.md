# Topics to deep dive
- [ ] `String` (String Object) vs `&String` (String Reference) vs `&str` (string reference)
- [ ] `iter()` vs `into_iter()` vs `for num in num`
- [ ] type casting
  - [ ] `as <type>` syntax (e.g. `as usize`) => are the other ways to typecast?
  - [ ] how to deal with results from computations? e.g `.len()`? Cast which variable to which?
  - [ ] string conversions => general rules
  - [ ] number conversions (int vs float)
- [ ] closures => 
  - [ ] write function and closure hat do the same and compare
  - [ ] write map function and compare to map() that expects closure
  - [ ] 
- [ ] dive deep into iterator type
- [ ] Options VS Results
